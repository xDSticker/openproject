    # business logic of whether to send or not to send a mail is mainly driven by the presence
    # of an aggregated journal. However, there is an edge case that could lead to a notification
    # getting lost. Sadly this is very implementation specific, so I'll describe it:
    #  Journal 1: comment
    #  Journal 2: change (this can also be multiple journals)
    #  Journal 3: comment
    #
    # The Job for the first journal will not send any mail, because Journal 2 supersedes it.
    # However, after adding Journal 3, the aggregation will look like (1), (2, 3). Therefore the
    # job for Journal 2 will not send a notification. Finally the job for Journal 3 will send a
    # notification, but only containing the changes of 2 and 3. The comment of journal 1 is lost.
    # Therefore two things have to happen:
    # - someone needs to send notifications for the hidden journal
    #   (done by JournalNotificationMailer)
    # - in case a journal is hidden, its Job is not allowed to enqueue a mail for it
    #   (because someone else will do it on behalf)
    #   This is important since late exec of a Job might cause it to _not_ skip notifications
